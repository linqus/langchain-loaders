    <p>
      <b>CSV</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, 
      a flat file format describing values in a table.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each record consists of M values, separated by commas.  However, the last
      value is not followed by a comma.
    </p>

    <p>
      Double quotes are used as escape characters.  A string with a comma can
      be delimited by double quotes so that that comma is not misinterpreted
      as a field separator.
    </p>

    <p>
      To de-escape a double quote, that is, to use it literally, use two
      double quotes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A final, unmatched, double quote on a line indicates that that line
      is to be continued on the next line.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, a CSV file includes an initial line of headers.
